See [Logging Basics](logging/logging-basics.NVRdAifUIF), [Logging Reflection](logging/logging-reflection.NVRdAifUIF) or consider logging to a [Neo4j](technology/neo4j/index.NVRdAifUIF) graph database. This last one allows you to browse the logging results in the Neo4j perspective.

Other options include the [Pipeline Log](metadata-types/pipeline-log.NVRdAifUIF), [Pipeline Probe](metadata-types/pipeline-probe.NVRdAifUIF), [Workflow log](metadata-types/workflow-log.NVRdAifUIF) and [Execution Information Location](metadata-types/execution-information-location.NVRdAifUIF). Take a look at the available options and choose a logging strategy that works for your project and team.
