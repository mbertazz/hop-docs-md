Hop comes with a set of samples for workflows, pipelines, actions, transforms and other metadata objects.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

This `samples` project is included in your Hop installation in the `config/projects/samples` folder. You can open individual sample workflows or pipelines, or add a [Hop project](projects/index.Sysff4PLyL), pointing the project’s home directory to the `samples` folder.

<div class="paragraph">

The samples project is work in progress. More samples will gradually be added until feature completeness.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

The project’s folder structure may change over time, but is intended to be self-explanatory: you’ll find sample workflows and pipelines along with samples that have been organized in folder by action or transform name. For example, the 'workflowexecutor' folder contains a workflow and pipeline that show how to use the workflow executor transform (to execute workflows) in a pipeline.
