## Core Concepts

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

Before we dive deeper, let’s take a minute to familiarize ourselves with the Hop lingo.

<div class="paragraph">

**Metadata** is by far the most important concept in all of Hop. Every item we’ll cover below is defined as metadata. All interactions between Hop and other components in your data architecture are done through metadata. *Metadata is at the core of **everything** in Hop*.

<div class="ulist">

  - **Pipelines** are collections of **transforms**, connected by **hops**. All transforms in a pipeline run in parallel.

  - **Workflows** are collections of **actions**, connected by **hops**. All actions in a workflow run sequentially by default.

  - **Projects** are logical collections of hop code and configuration. **Environments** contain the environment-specific (e.g. dev, uat, prd) metadata.
