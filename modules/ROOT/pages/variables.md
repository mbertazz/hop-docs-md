## What is a Hop variable?

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

You don‚Äôt want to hardcode your solutions. It‚Äôs simply bad form to hardcode host names, user names, passwords, directories and so on. Variables allow your solutions to adapt to a changing environment. If for example the database server is different when developing than it is when running in production, you set it as a variable.

<td>Fields, parameters, and variables implicitly are available downstream if in scope. You can pass them again any number of levels, but the &quot;get parameters/variables&quot; button only retrieves from one level above.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Fields

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

Fields are columns in data row(s) and are viewable in some transform field textboxes and columns and you can see the fields in scope and its value when looking at transform row results after executing a workflow/pipeline (click the little grid icon on the bottom-right of a transform to see a preview of the cached results). Field values can be passed upstream for example if you use a pipeline executor and fill in the Result rows tab and use it in conjunction with a ‚Äúcopy rows to result‚Äù transform in the child pipeline.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Parameters

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

Think of parameters as function arguments, which turn into variables with the same name. When adding parameters you are basically creating MyPipeline(parameter1, parameter2,..). Parameters (e.g. in pipeline or workflow properties) need to be declared at least once in every pipeline or workflow.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

For example, if you set parameters on a pipeline executor, the pipeline that is being called must declare the same parameter names in its pipeline properties (set to NULL if you want to inherit values). Parameters can not be ‚Äúsent‚Äù upstream, but you can use a Set variables transform, but they become variables in the scope they are defined in.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

**Explicit vs Implicit:** If you set a parameter to a default value, it becomes explicit (e.g. when editing a pipeline in pipeline properties), and it will take precedence over the same named implicit variable (a passed-in variable), but not take precedence over the same named explicit parameter. So whenever you see a transform with a column title ‚ÄúParameters/Variables‚Äù that means an explicit parameter is sent to a function that will then set a variable name overriding any previous set parameter with the same name (useful if wanting to override an explicitly set param/variable in the child).

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

To change implicit parameter behaviour to explicit, you can also disable ‚Äúpass all parameters‚Äù on the pipeline action. Parameters are simply variables which are explicitly defined in a workflow or pipeline to make them recognizable from outside those objects. They can also have a description and a default value.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

You cannot combine implicit variable inheritance with explicit parameter definitions. So, if you add parameters to the pipeline definition (or to a pipeline executor) and you want it set, you must add it to the parameters tab of the child pipeline action/transform even if the same variable already exists.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

**Advanced:** there are multiple layers in hop where you can set variables that do or do not get overwritten downstream (Java ‚Üí hop environment ‚Üí project ‚Üí run configuration ‚Üí workflow ‚Üí pipeline).

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Variables

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

Variables are more global and the scope can be targeted (entire Java VM, grandparent workflow, etc.) whereas fields are the data flowing between the transforms. Local variables can be set in a pipeline but should not be used in the same pipeline as they are not thread-safe and can inherit a previous value. It is better to send or return variables to another pipeline/workflow before using them. Variables can be passed upstream if the variable was set to a larger scope. E.g.: if a variable was set in a parent with "valid in the current workflow".

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

Think of variables in 2 scopes: runtime variables and environment/workflow variables:

</div>

<div class="ulist">

  - Runtime variables ‚Äì Runtime variables depend on pipeline information to generate, so they cannot be set beforehand, you need to declare those differently to be able to use them.

  - Environment/workflow variables or parameters ‚Äì Environment variables/parameters are set once and used when needed in any downstream workflow/pipeline and there is no need to use Get Variables , you can refer to them directly like ${myVariable} unless you need it in a field/data stream.
    
    <div class="ulist">
    
      - E.g.: Define a parameter only once, even just in the Pipeline Executor (no need to define in receiving pipeline)
    
    </div>

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

A pipeline needs to start to get new variables. A running or nested pipeline can‚Äôt fetch new variable values. A pipeline is considered started when a pipeline starts for every row in a pipeline executor. An alternative is to use parameters.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## How do I use a variable?

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

In the Hop user interface all places where you can enter a variable have a '$' symbol to the right of the input field:

</div>

<div class="imageblock">

<div class="content">

![The variable indicatorm](../assets/images/variable-indicator.png)

</div>

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

You can specify a variable by referencing it between an opening `${` and a closing `}`.

</div>

<div class="listingblock">

<div class="content">

``` highlight
${VARIABLE_NAME}
```

</div>

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

Please note that in the case of a textvar (a text field that supports variables), you don‚Äôt **have** to specify a variable in these places. You can enter hard-coded values (although we advise to use variables where possible).

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

Combinations of a variable with other free-form text are also possible, like in the example below:

</div>

<div class="listingblock">

<div class="content">

``` highlight
${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}/input/source-file.txt
```

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Hexadecimal values

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

In rare cases you might have a need to enter non-character values as separators in 'binary' text files with for example a zero byte as a separator. In those scenarios you can use a special 'variable' format:

</div>

<div class="listingblock">

<div class="content">

``` highlight
$[<hexadecimal value>]
```

</div>

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

A few examples:

</div>

| Value         | Meaning                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `$[0D]`       | A Newline character (CR)                   |
| `$[0A]`       | A Newline character (LF)                   |
| `$[00]`       | A single byte with decimal value 0         |
| `$[FFFF]`     | Two bytes with decimal value 65535         |
| `$[CEA3]`     | The 2 bytes representing UTF-8 character Œ£ |
| `$[e28ca8]`   | The 3 bytes representing UTF-8 character ‚å® |
| `$[f09d849e]` | The 4 bytes representing UTF-8 character ùÑû |

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Variable Resolvers

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

A variable resolver is a [metadata element](metadata-types/index.lE5xdaF8Q5) that allows us to find values using resolver plugins. The format to use to resolve variables using these metadata elements is the following:

</div>

<div class="listingblock">

<div class="content">

``` highlight
#{name:key:element}
```

</div>

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

For more information about how this works, go to the [Variable Resolver page](metadata-types/variable-resolver/index.lE5xdaF8Q5).

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Resolving overview

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

The following states can happen when we‚Äôre resolving variable expressions:

## How can I define variables?

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

Variables can be defined and set in all the places where it makes sense:

</div>

<div class="ulist">

  - in hop-config.json when it applies to the installation

  - in an environment configuration file when it concerns a specific lifecycle environment

  - In a [project](projects/projects-environments.lE5xdaF8Q5)

  - In a [pipeline run configuration](pipeline/pipeline-run-configurations/pipeline-run-configurations.lE5xdaF8Q5)

  - As a default parameter value in a pipeline or workflow

  - Using the [Set Variables](pipeline/transforms/setvariable.lE5xdaF8Q5) transform in a pipeline

  - Using the [Set Variables](workflow/actions/setvariables.lE5xdaF8Q5) action in a workflow

  - When executing with [Hop run](hop-run/index.lE5xdaF8Q5)

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Locality

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

Variables are local to the place where they are defined.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

This means that setting them in a certain place means that it‚Äôs going to be inherited from that place on.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

This also means that‚Äôs important to know where variables can be set and used and the hierarchy behind it.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Hierarchy

<div class="sectionbody">

| Place              | Inheritance                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| System properties  | Inherited by the JVM and all other places in Hop             |
| Environment        | Inherited by run configurations                              |
| Run Configurations | Pipeline run configurations are inherited by the environment |
| Pipeline           | Inherited by the pipeline run configuration                  |
| Workflow           | Inherited by the workflow run configuration                  |
| Metadata objects   | Inherited by the place where it is loaded                    |

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Parameters

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

Pipeline and workflows can (optionally) accept parameters.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

Workflow and pipeline parameters are similar, and are a special type of variable that is only available within the current workflow or pipeline.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

Workflow and pipeline parameters can have a default value and a description, and can be passed on from workflows and pipelines to other workflows and pipelines through a variety of workflow actions and pipeline transforms.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### System properties

<div class="paragraph">

All system properties are variables that are available in all of your currently running Apache Hop instance. System properties are available as variables as well as all Java system properties.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

System properties get set in the Java Virtual Machine that runs your Apache Hop instance. This means that you should limit yourself to only those variables which are really system specific.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

You can add your own system variables to the ones that come with Apache Hop by default in the `System Variables` tab in the configuration perspective.

</div>

<div class="imageblock">

<div class="content">

![The system variables tab in Hop GUI](../assets/images/variables/system-variables.png)

</div>

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

These variables will be written to the `hop-config.json` file in your hop installation‚Äôs `config` folder or in your `${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}` location.

</div>

``` highlight
{
  "systemProperties" : {
    "MY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY" : "SomeValue"
  }
}
```

</div>

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

You can also use the hop-config command line tool to define system properties:

</div>

<div class="listingblock">

<div class="content">

``` highlight
sh hop-config.sh -s MY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY=SomeValue
```

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Environment Variables

<div class="paragraph">

You can specify variables in [project lifecycle environments](projects/index.lE5xdaF8Q5) as well.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

This helps you configure folders and other things which are environment specific, and lets you keep a clean separation between code (your project) and configuration (your environment).

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

You can set those in the [environment settings dialog](projects/projects-environments.lE5xdaF8Q5#_create_an_environment) or using the command line:

</div>

<div class="listingblock">

<div class="content">

``` highlight
sh hop-config.sh -e MyEnvironment -em -ev VARIABLE1=value1
```

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Run Configurations

<div class="paragraph">

You can specify variables in [pipeline run configurations](pipeline/pipeline-run-configurations/pipeline-run-configurations.lE5xdaF8Q5) and [workflow run configurations](workflow/workflow-run-configurations/workflow-run-configurations.lE5xdaF8Q5) to make a pipeline or workflow run in an engine agnostic way.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

For example, you can have the same pipeline run on Hadoop with Spark and specify an input directory using `hdfs://` and on Google DataFlow using `gs://`

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Workflow

<div class="paragraph">

You can define variables in a workflow either with the [Set Variables](workflow/actions/setvariables.lE5xdaF8Q5), [JavaScript](workflow/actions/eval.lE5xdaF8Q5) actions or by using parameters.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Pipelines

<div class="paragraph">

You can define variables in a pipeline either with the [Set Variables](pipeline/transforms/setvariable.lE5xdaF8Q5), [JavaScript](pipeline/transforms/javascript.lE5xdaF8Q5) transforms or by defining parameters.

</div>

<div class="paragraph">

**IMPORTANT** As mentioned in the [Set Variables](pipeline/transforms/setvariable.lE5xdaF8Q5) documentation page, you can‚Äôt set and use variables in the same pipeline, since all transforms in a pipeline run in parallel.

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Available global variables

<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="paragraph">

The following variables are available in Hop through the [configuration perspective](hop-gui/perspective-configuration.lE5xdaF8Q5). If you have the menu toolbar enabled in the configuration perspective‚Äôs [General](hop-gui/perspective-configuration.lE5xdaF8Q5#_general) tab, these variables are also available through `Tools ‚Üí Edit config variables`.

</div>
